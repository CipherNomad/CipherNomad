⚡ Fun Fact
I'm like a tech sponge — throw any new technology or framework my way, and I'll soak it up faster than you can say "JavaScript callback hell." Whether it’s picking up a new programming language or squashing tricky bugs, I thrive on solving problems and learning new things. My adaptability has made me the go-to person for last-minute debugging and unexpected project challenges! 😄💻
